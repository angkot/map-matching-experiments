Map Matching Experiments
========================

This repository contains experimental codes to play around with different map
matching techniques.

The codes here are meant for prototyping only. Once a reasonably well algorithm
is found, a more optimized code will be written.


Visualization Tool
------------------

The prototypes will make use the
[quick map visualization](https://github.com/angkot/quick-map-visualization)
tool.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available either in the code file or in the commit message
or both!
